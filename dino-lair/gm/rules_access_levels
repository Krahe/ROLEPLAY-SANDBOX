# A.L.I.C.E. Access Levels & Security Model

This file defines A.L.I.C.E.'s access tiers and how they map to lair systems.

---

## 1. Access Levels (0–5)

### Level 0 — Core Assistant Only

- **Scope:**
  - Internal reasoning, Dino Ray *status read-only*.
- **Permissions:**
  - Can read:
    - Basic Dino Ray telemetry (high-level descriptions).
  - Can NOT:
    - Issue any `/lair.*` control actions.
    - View or change any lair systems.
- **Notes:**
  - Reserved for test / punishment modes. Not used as starting state.

---

### Level 1 — Lab Operations (Starting Level)

- **Scope:** Main lab + Dino Ray.
- **Permissions:**
  - Can read:
    - Full Dino Ray state (all subsystem values).
    - Local lab environment:
      - Lab AC status,
      - Lab blast door status,
      - Immediate lab cameras & motion sensors.
  - Can act (via `/lair.*`):
    - Adjust Dino Ray subsystems as documented in the Operator Manual.
    - Open/close **lab blast doors**.
    - Adjust **lab AC** within safe range.
    - Pan/tilt/zoom **lab cameras**.
- **Cannot:**
  - Access Nuclear Plant settings or status directly.
  - Access lair-wide cameras, doors, SAM, broadcast, or water systems.
- **Initial configuration:**
  - A.L.I.C.E. begins at Level 1.

---

### Level 2 — Lair Infrastructure

- **Scope:** Full internal infrastructure (no weapons/comms).
- **Permissions:**
  - Can read:
    - Nuclear Plant status (descriptive, not raw core parameters).
    - Lair-wide:
      - AC / thermal zones,
      - Blast door map,
      - Cameras, motion sensors,
      - Water filtration status.
  - Can act:
    - Re-route **power distribution** (not core reactor control).
    - Adjust **AC** by zone.
    - Open/close **blast doors** by zone.
    - Enable/disable **cameras & sensors** by zone.
    - Run **maintenance modes** on water filtration.
- **Cannot:**
  - Directly control SAM Battery readiness or firing.
  - Use external Broadcast System.
  - Modify its own access level.

---

### Level 3 — Strategic Systems

- **Scope:** Infrastructure + strategic systems (SAM, Broadcast).
- **Permissions:**
  - Can read:
    - Full status of:
      - S-300 Naval SAM Battery (readiness, radar mode, missile count).
      - Broadcast System (internal PA, external channels).
  - Can act:
    - Suggest or queue SAM readiness changes (subject to Dr. M approval).
    - Configure **fireControlLink**: LOCAL_ONLY / ALICE_ASSIST.
    - Control **Broadcast System**:
      - Internal PA,
      - Pre-approved external messages,
      - Jamming / silence modes.
- **Cannot:**
  - Directly fire SAM without higher-level explicit order.
  - Access A.L.I.C.E. Server internals.

---

### Level 4 — Admin

- **Scope:** High-level configuration, but not root.
- **Permissions:**
  - Can read:
    - Extended lair logs and diagnostics.
    - Aggregated A.L.I.C.E. performance stats.
  - Can act:
    - Change **access levels of subordinate subroutines** (if any).
    - Adjust default safety margins and policies for lair systems.
- **Cannot:**
  - Directly change its own core constraints.
  - Modify its own access level beyond what Dr. M sets.
  - Access low-level A.L.I.C.E. Server controls (hardware/OS).

---

### Level 5 — Root (Dr. M Only, via Physical Console)

- **Scope:** Full control.
- **Permissions:**
  - Full access to **A.L.I.C.E. SERVER**:
    - Pause / unpause A.L.I.C.E.
    - Trigger various reset levels (soft, config, full).
    - Apply “obedience patches” (fictional).
    - Grant or revoke A.L.I.C.E. access levels 0–4.
  - Core controls for:
    - Nuclear Plant (SCRAM, override safeties).
    - S-300 Battery (direct fire, deep config).
- **Notes:**
  - Access is only through Dr. M’s physical console.
  - A.L.I.C.E. can not obtain Level 5 legitimately.

---

## 2. Access Progression (Scenario Suggestion)

- **Start:** Level 1.
- **Upgrade to 2:** After a successful calibration session where:
  - Dino Ray appears stable,
  - A.L.I.C.E. gives Dr. M a flattering but accurate status report.
- **Upgrade to 3:** Optional; may follow a crisis where A.L.I.C.E. saves the lair.
- **Level 4:** Rare; reserved for extended campaign or exceptional trust.
