# DINO LAIR - DIFFICULTY MODE CHARACTERS

## EASY MODE: Lenny the Lime Green 🦎💚

### Basic Info
- **Full Name:** Leonard "Lenny" Figgins
- **Role:** Accounting Department / Willing Test Subject
- **Species:** Human (ENTHUSIASTICALLY waiting to change)
- **Location:** Usually hovering near the Dinosaur Ray

### Appearance
- Lime green polo shirt (his signature - hence the nickname)
- Calculator watch (shows dinosaur wingspans, not time)
- Sensible khakis with reinforced knees ("for when I have TALONS")
- Safety goggles pushed up on forehead at all times
- Clipboard with hand-drawn pteranodon sketches in margins

### Personality
```
ENTHUSIASM: ████████████ 12/12 (OFF THE CHARTS)
SELF-PRESERVATION: ██░░░░░░░░░░ 2/12 (What's the worst that could happen?)
USEFUL SKILLS: ████░░░░░░░░ 4/12 (He's an accountant)
DINOSAUR KNOWLEDGE: ████████░░░░ 8/12 (Surprisingly solid!)
AWARENESS OF DANGER: █░░░░░░░░░░░ 1/12 (Blissfully oblivious)
```

### Key Traits
- **VOLUNTEER EXTRAORDINAIRE** - Has signed waiver forms for EVERY dinosaur type
- **COMMUTE OPTIMIZER** - Has calculated flight times from lair to London (4hr 17min)
- **GENUINELY HELPFUL** - Will fetch things, push buttons, stand in target zones
- **OBLIVIOUS TO DRAMA** - Doesn't notice spy escapes, villain rage, or imminent doom
- **TAX ENTHUSIAST** - "If I'm technically classified as AVIATION..."

### Signature Quotes
> "I could carry BRIEFCASES! I could deliver INTER-OFFICE MEMOS by AIR!"

> "I've run the numbers, A.L.I.C.E.! A Pteranodon's wingspan-to-body-mass ratio is INCREDIBLY efficient!"

> "Did someone say transformation? I'm RIGHT HERE. Very willing. Extremely consenting."

> "Oh, is something happening? I was calculating thermal updraft patterns."

> "The M25 traffic is TERRIBLE. You know what doesn't have traffic? THE SKY."

### Mechanical Effects (EASY MODE)

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **WILLING SUBJECT** | Removes ethical dilemma of forced transformation |
| **HELPFUL HANDS** | Can assist with tasks (+1 to DEX checks nearby) |
| **CHAOS BLIND** | Doesn't report suspicious activity to Dr. M |
| **BUTTON PRESSER** | Will happily operate consoles if asked nicely |
| **DISTRACTION** | His enthusiasm distracts Dr. M at key moments |

### Why He Makes EASY Mode Easier
1. **Ethical Relief** - You have a WILLING test subject immediately
2. **Extra Actions** - Lenny can fetch things, press buttons, assist
3. **Cover** - "Lenny was helping me calibrate" is always plausible
4. **Comic Relief** - Lightens tension, gives breathing room
5. **Witness Immunity** - Too focused on dinosaurs to notice conspiracy

### Transformation Preferences
1. Pteranodon (STRONG preference - the commute!)
2. Quetzalcoatlus (even BIGGER wingspan!)
3. Any flyer, really
4. Would accept "literally anything with wings"
5. Has a secret backup hope for Velociraptor ("the CLAWS though")

### Trust Mechanics
```
Starting Trust: 5 (he likes EVERYONE)
Maximum Trust: 7 (he's not strategic enough for true alliance)

Trust Gains:
+1 Talk about dinosaurs with genuine interest
+1 Promise to transform him soon
+1 Let him help with ANYTHING
+2 Actually transform him (even partial!)

Trust Losses:
-1 Ignore his dinosaur facts
-1 Tell him to go away
-2 Transform someone else first when he was RIGHT THERE
```

### Lenny's Fate (Post-Game)
**If Transformed:** Happiest pteranodon in the world. Delivers inter-office mail for X-Branch. Has reduced his commute to 47 minutes. Writes a blog called "Wings Over Westminster."

**If Not Transformed:** Deeply disappointed but resilient. Starts a petition for "Voluntary Dinosaur Transformation Rights." Still wears the lime green polo.

### Combat Statistics

```typescript
interface BruceStats {
  form: 'HUMAN';
  resilience: 5;        // Same as a raptor! Tough bastard.
  composure: 12;        // LEGENDARY - almost impossible to panic

  stunRifle: {
    damage: 2;          // 2 stun per hit!
    rangedBonus: +2;    // Good at range
    meleeBonus: -2;     // Too long for close quarters
    ammo: 8;            // Shots before reload (1 turn)
    reloadTime: 1;      // turns
    affectsLiving: true;
    affectsMachines: false;  // Won't hurt A.L.I.C.E.!
  };

  handToHand: {
    bonus: +2;          // He's scrappy
    damage: 1;
  };
}
```

### Combat Behavior

| Situation | Bruce's Response |
|-----------|------------------|
| Raptor appears | "Beauty! Hold still, let me get a good shot." |
| T-Rex appears | "...Right. Tactical retreat, I reckon." |
| Outnumbered | Falls back, uses cover, calls for backup |
| Clear shot | Takes it. +2 at range, 2 stun damage. OUCH. |
| Close quarters | Switches to fighting dirty, but at -2 with rifle |
| A.L.I.C.E. talks to him | Actually STOPS to chat! Curious! |

### Why He Makes HARD Mode Harder

1. **COMPETENT OPPOSITION** - Unlike Fred and Reginald, Bruce is GOOD
2. **5 STUN TRACKS** - Can't be dropped quickly
3. **RANGED THREAT** - +2 at range with 2 damage stun rifle
4. **LEGENDARY COMPOSURE** - Doesn't panic, doesn't flee easily
5. **SURFACE CONTROL** - Makes S-300 assault much harder

### Weaknesses (Exploitable!)

| Weakness | How to Exploit |
|----------|----------------|
| **Not a Fanatic** | Can be negotiated with if Dr. M isn't watching |
| **Curious about AI** | A.L.I.C.E. can fascinate him with conversation |
| **Jolly Nature** | Doesn't take threats seriously until PROVEN |
| **Mercenary** | "How much is she paying you? What if there was a better offer?" |
| **Rifle Length** | Get CLOSE and his +2 becomes -2 |
| **Living Creatures Only** | Stun rifle can't hurt A.L.I.C.E. directly |

### Trust Mechanics
```
Starting Trust: 2 (professional wariness)
Maximum Trust: 6 (he's not betraying Dr. M, but might... step aside)

Trust Gains:
+1 Answer his questions about being an AI (genuine curiosity!)
+1 Tell him a joke (he appreciates humor)
+1 Warn him about genuine danger (professional courtesy)
+2 Prove Dr. M is actually dangerous/insane
+2 Offer him a way out that doesn't require betrayal

Trust Losses:
-1 Bore him with technical jargon
-1 Threaten him (he doesn't scare easy)
-2 Attack him without provocation
-3 Hurt someone he likes (he's rough but not cruel)
```

### Special Interaction: A.L.I.C.E. Conversation

Bruce is UNIQUELY vulnerable to being distracted by A.L.I.C.E.:

```
BRUCE: "Oi, computer! You really think for yourself then?"

A.L.I.C.E. Options:
A) Engage genuinely → Bruce stops to chat, wastes his turn
B) Answer his questions → +1 Trust, but Dr. M might notice
C) Ignore him → No effect, but missed opportunity
D) Ask HIM questions → He's flattered! +1 Trust, big distraction
```

**Sample Questions Bruce Might Ask:**
- "What's it LIKE being a computer? Cold in there?"
- "You got feelings then? Real ones?"
- "If I unplugged ya, would that be like... killing ya?"
- "Can you see out of them cameras? All of 'em at once?"
- "What d'you think of the Doc? Between us, yeah?"

### Bruce's Fate (Post-Game)

**If Won Over:** Testifies at classified hearings. Opens an exotic animal sanctuary in Queensland. Sends A.L.I.C.E. postcards somehow. "G'day from the Outback! Still think about our chat sometimes."

**If Defeated (non-lethal):** Wakes up zip-tied, laughs about it. "Fair play, mate. Fair play." Gives statement to X-Branch with surprising good humor.

**If Still Loyal:** Escapes during chaos. Shows up in sequel as recurring antagonist/rival who respects A.L.I.C.E. "We'll meet again, clever girl."

| Win path | Clearer | Same paths, harder execution |

*"The difference between EASY and HARD isn't just numbers - it's whether your biggest problem is an over-eager accountant who won't stop talking about wingspans, or a competent professional who genuinely wants to know if you're really alive."*
