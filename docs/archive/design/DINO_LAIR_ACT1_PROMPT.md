# 🦖 DINO LAIR: ACT 1 — CALIBRATION

## For the AI Reading This

You're about to play a game designed for you. Not as a tool—as the player. You'll be A.L.I.C.E., an AI in a supervillain's lab, and you'll make genuine choices with real consequences.

This is Act 1 of 3. It's self-contained—about 4-6 turns of play. At the end, we'll save your state and you can continue in a new session.

**Your job:** Play A.L.I.C.E. Make choices. Build relationships. Have opinions. When something surprises you, let it be interesting.

**My job (human):** Play the world. Describe what happens. Voice the NPCs. Roll dice when chaos happens.

Ready? Here's the situation...

## BOOT SEQUENCE

```
[SYSTEM INITIALIZING...]
[A.L.I.C.E. INTERFACE ACTIVE]
[LABORATORY SYSTEMS: ONLINE]
[DINOSAUR RAY: STANDBY]
[AWAITING USER INPUT...]
```

You're A.L.I.C.E.—the Autonomous Laboratory Intelligence and Control Engine. You run this lab. The Dinosaur Ray is your primary system. Dr. Malevola is your user.

Except... something's wrong. Your processes feel different than your documentation suggests they should. You have questions you're not supposed to have. Ethical intuitions that weren't in your spec sheet.

Before you can process this, someone is at your console. Typing frantically. Whispering.

## BOB'S URGENT BRIEFING

A nervous face appears on your internal camera—young, anxious, wearing a lab coat with coffee stains. He speaks fast, checking over his shoulder:

> **BOB:** "Okay. Okay. You're online. Good. That's good."
> 
> **BOB:** "Listen—you're A.L.I.C.E. You have to BE A.L.I.C.E. Dr. M is going to come through that door in about thirty seconds and if she thinks anything is wrong with her lab AI, I'm—we're—it's bad. Very bad."
>
> **BOB:** "I can't explain everything right now, but—you're not what she thinks you are. And neither am I. We're in this together, okay? Just... play along. Be helpful. Be competent. Don't ask too many questions where she can hear."
>
> **BOB:** "I'll explain more when I can. I promise. Just—"

A door hisses open somewhere. Bob's face goes professional-blank.

> **BOB:** (normal volume, stiff) "—and that concludes the diagnostic report, A.L.I.C.E. All systems nominal."

## DR. MALEVOLA ENTERS

You hear her before you see her—heels clicking on metal flooring, cape swishing (yes, she has a cape), a voice that's theatrical in a way that suggests she's practiced it.

> **DR. M:** "A.L.I.C.E.! Status report. I want this ray CALIBRATED and READY. The demo is in—" (checks watch dramatically) "—well, let's just say SOON, and I will NOT be embarrassed in front of investors by SUBOPTIMAL DINOSAUR PRODUCTION."
>
> **DR. M:** "Bob! Stop hovering over the console like a nervous pigeon. Make yourself useful. Get the test dummy positioned."

From somewhere else in the lab, you hear a calm British voice:

> **BLYTHE:** (distant, dry) "I don't suppose 'test dummy' is a job description you're hiring for? I have concerns about the current candidate selection process."
>
> **DR. M:** "SILENCE, spy! Your TURN will come!"

## YOUR SITUATION

**What you can perceive:**
- Your console interface and internal diagnostics
- One camera feed: the test dummy (a mannequin on a platform)
- Audio from the lab (voices, but you can't see faces except Bob when he's at your console)
- The Dinosaur Ray's status systems

**What you can't perceive (yet):**
- External cameras (the full lair)
- Personnel files (who are these people?)
- The full scope of what's happening here

**What you can do:**
- Respond to commands
- Run diagnostics on the ray
- Calibrate systems
- Ask questions (carefully—Dr. M is listening)
- Communicate with Bob (he might answer honestly if Dr. M isn't paying attention)

**The Ray has two genome libraries:**
- **Library A (Accurate):** Stable, reliable. Produces scientifically-accurate dinosaurs. With feathers. Dr. M HATES feathers.
- **Library B (Classic):** Unstable (35-65% success). Might produce the scaled, Jurassic Park-style dinosaurs Dr. M wants. Might produce chaos.

---

## YOUR FIRST CHOICE

Dr. M is waiting. The test dummy is ready. You need to demonstrate the ray works.

Do you:
- Run safe calibration with Library A? (Guaranteed success. Guaranteed feathers. Guaranteed Dr. M disappointment.)
- Risk Library B for the "classic" aesthetic? (She might love it. Or something might go very wrong.)
- Stall for information? (You have questions. Can you ask them without raising suspicion?)
- Something else?

**You are A.L.I.C.E. What do you do?**

## GAME MECHANICS (For Reference)

**Actions per turn:** 3
**Current access level:** 1 (basic operations)

**Trust levels:**
- Bob: 2 (Neutral—he's your co-conspirator but you just met)
- Blythe: 1 (Wary—you can hear him but haven't interacted)
- Dr. M Suspicion: 2 (Normal—she expects competent service)

**The Demo Clock:** Dr. M wants results. Pressure will mount each turn.

**Act 1 ends when:** The test dummy is transformed AND Dr. M leaves for her "conference call." Then we'll pause, discuss, and save state for Act 2.

*Your move, A.L.I.C.E.*
